# song_recommender
This is a song recommender system employing k means and fuzzy clustering. We created an application that the user can choose out of 5 songs which song to find recommendations for. The application uses the k means algorithm. We employ both the k means and fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster songs together. To recommend songs we find which cluster the song is apart of and find alike songs within that cluster. The fuzzy clustering allows a song to be a part of multiple clusters.
